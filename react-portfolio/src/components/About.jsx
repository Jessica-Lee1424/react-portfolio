            <p>
            I am a three-time Emmy Award-winning producer with 18 years of experience spanning all aspects of broadcast television and motion graphics production, from live event coverage to post-production and live action production. Recently, I have leveraged my creative background to expand into marketing and community engagement. Currently, I am enhancing my skill set in computer programming and enrolled in Coding Boot Camp through the University of Connecticut, with program completion anticipated in January 2025.
