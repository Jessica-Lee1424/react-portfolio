          <h4>Module 9 Challenge: </h4> This is an example of a challenge that lived up to its name in that I was very challenged and have a lot of room for improvement here. The project in this repository needs to be reworked. My goal is to return to this code before the course program ends and correct the errors to get the API working as expected. <br />
